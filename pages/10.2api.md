There are two kinds of API:
1. API for platform websites to get data from the database
2. Microservices API such as [CrawlerHub](#crawlerhub), Gender guesser API, etc

For #1 API, usually, the front-end team creates their own API using NodeJS. However, for some projects, our team (Python) creates the API. The #2 API so far Python team creates the API.

### Framework of choice
1. [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/): create the API everything from the ground up. Takes time to build a bigger project, but is easier to understand. Security is not embedded.
2. [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) + [DRF](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/): Currently the better choice in creating API faster and more secure. But it is harder to learn (because they have everything built-in) compared to Flask.

We have Flask as the framework for the older project (such as CrawlerHub). However, we are planning to use Django for future API projects (bigger ones) for having better maintainability.

### Best practice
#### API
So far we are still learning how to create a better API.

One thing that we know we shouldn't do is having API without doing a [versioning](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/versioning/). This will create an inconsistent API and will be a hard time for any of the project that uses the API.
The way we do the management of codebase version:
```
.
├── api
    ├── v1
    └── v2
```
the codebase for `v2` is literally a copy-paste version from `v1` with the intended adjustment change.

#### Django
I don't know much. but
> Fat models are preferred to fat views.

Maybe [this](https://github.com/HackSoftware/Django-Styleguide) helps.
