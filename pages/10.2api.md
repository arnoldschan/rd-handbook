There are two kinds of API:
1. API for platform websites to get data from the database
2. Microservices API such as [CrawlerHub](#crawlerhub), Gender guesser API, etc

For #1 API, usually, the front-end team creates their own API using NodeJS. However, for some projects, our team (Python) creates the API. The #2 API so far Python team creates the API.

### Framework of choice
1. [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/): create the API everything from the ground up. Takes time to build a bigger project, but is easier to understand. Security is not embedded.
2. [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) + [DRF](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/): Currently the better choice in creating API faster and more secure. But it is harder to learn (because they have everything built-in) compared to Flask.

for microservices, Flask is more suitable. But for Database API, Django is easier.
### Best practice
#### API
We shouldn't do API without doing a [versioning](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/versioning/). This will create an inconsistent API and will be a hard time for any of the project that uses the API.
The way we do the management of codebase version:
```
.
├── api
    ├── v1
    └── v2
```
the codebase for `v2` is literally a duplicated version from `v1` with the intended adjustment change.

#### Django
API framework with MVC method:
- Model: DB connector (`models.py`)
- View: Serve to client (`views.py`)
- Controller: Formatting the result for client (`serializers.py`)

Suggestions:
- Class based views are more preferred.
- Try to put most of the logic in `model.py`, so that the logic can be reused from other places.
- Use [`ModelViewSet`](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/viewsets/) for CRUD API.
- If exist, try to use [Reusable Apps](https://djangopackages.org) to reduce the development time.
- You can use Mongodb as backend with [Djongo](https://github.com/doableware/djongo). However, we found the package isn't well maintained and many bugs with higher version of Django may occurs.
